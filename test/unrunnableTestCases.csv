Axes089,Error: XPST0003: Unable to parse XPath: " xquery version "1.0"; declare namespace saxon="http://saxon.sf.net/"; declare namespace tour="http://wrox.com/tour";  (:     XQuery program to perform a knight's tour of the chessboard.     Author: Michael H. Kay     Date: 26 June 2003          This version modified to use XQuery 1.0, with sequences and functions.      This query does not use a source document.     There is an optional parameter, start, which can be set to any square on the     chessboard, e.g. a3 or h5. XQuery does not allow parameters to be given a     default value, so the parameter is mandatory.          There is a second optional parameter, end, which indicates that the processing should stop     after a given number of steps. This can be used to animate the display of the tour. This     works especially well when the query is compiled into a Java servlet.      The output is an HTML display of the completed tour.

A square that has not been visited yet is represented by a zero.     * A set of possible moves: represented as a sequence of integers,     * each integer representing the number of the destination square        :)  declare variable $start as xs:string := "a1";  declare variable $end as xs:string := "64"; declare variable $endd as xs:integer := xs:integer($end);   (: start-column is an integer in the range 0-7 :)  declare variable $start-column as xs:integer :=     xs:integer(translate(substring($start, 1, 1),             'abcdefgh', '01234567'));  (: start-row is an integer in the range 0-7, with zero at the top :)  declare variable $start-row as xs:integer :=     8 - xs:integer(substring($start, 2, 1));      declare function tour:main () as element() {      (: This function controls the processing.
